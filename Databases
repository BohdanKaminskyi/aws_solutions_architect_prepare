Relational DBs on AWS (OLTP):
    - Microsoft SQL Server
    - Oracle
    - MySQL
    - PostgeSQL
    - Amazon Aurora
    - MariaDB

RDS (Relational DB Service)
    - Multi-AZ (for disaster recovery)
        . means, that if primary DB fails, aws starts to point to secondary db
    - Read Replicas - For Performance
        - whenever you do write to primary DB, that write is replicated to Read Replica
        - in case primary db fails, you need to manually repoint your instance to Replica
        - the point of replicas - if you have rly high READ load, some users will read from 1st db, and some from replica (scaling)
        - up to 5 copies


Non relational DBs:
    - Collection  == Table
    - Document    == Row
    - Key-value pairs == Columns
    - you can add new key-value pair even for just one record
    - DynamoDB


Data Warehousing (AWS Solution --- Redshift)
    - used for BI
    - tools like Cognos, Jaspersoft, SQL Server Reporting Services, Oracle Hyperion, SAP NetWeaver
    - used to pull in very large and complex datasets
    - usually used by management to do queries on data (such as current performance vs targets etc.)


OLTP vs OLAP
    - OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
    - OLAP (Online Analytics Processing)
    - differs in terms of the types of queries you will run

    . OLTP example: Order number 2341214 pulls up a row of data such as Name, Date, Address to Deliver to etc.
    . OLAP example: as a manager, i want to know net profit in some territory for the Digital Radio Product (pulls a lot of records)


ElastiCache
    - web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud (for example, loading top 10 products page of 1M/sec requests website)
    - the service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast,
      managed, in-memory caches instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based DBs
    - supports two open-source in-memory caching engines:
        . Redis
        . Memcached
