Route53
    - DNS Service
    - why named Route53 - DNS is on port 53
    - DNS is used to convert human-readable domain names into IP adresses
    - we created ipv6 because of running out of ipv4 adresses
    - top level domain - last word (.com, .edu)
    - top level domain names are controlled by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority in a root zone database
        (which is essentially a database of all available top level domains)
        . https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db - list of all top level domains
    - domain registrars
        . registrar is an authority that can assign domain names directly under one or more top-level domains
            - these domains are registered with InterNIC, a service of ICANN, which enforces uniqueness of domain
              names across the internet
            - each domain name becomes registered in a central database known as WhoIS database
    - each dns domain starts with SOA
        . SOA (Start Of Authority) Record
            - stores information about 
                . name of the server that supplied the data for the zone
                . administrator of the zone
                . current version of data file
                . default number of seconds for the TTL file on resource records
        . NS (Name Server) Record
            - used by top level domain servers to direct traffic to the Content DNS server which contains 
              the authoritative DNS records
    - Example: user types hellocloudguru.com
        1. browser goes to top level domain server (.com) and queries for authority record
        2. This gives you NS record
        3. Then you querying NS records
        4. This gives you SOA
        5. Here you get DNS records
     - Types of DNS records:
        - "A"
            . Address
            . Translates the name of the domain into IP Address
            . it's foundamental
        - "CNAME"
            . Can be used to resolve one domain name to another
            . example: you have m.site.com and you also want mobile.site.com to point to resovse to the same Address
        - "Alias"
            . used to map resources record sets in your hosted zone to Elastic Load Balancers, CloudFront distributions, or S3 buckets that are configured as websites
            . Alias records work like a CNAME record in that you can map one DNS name to another 'target' DNS name
        - "MX"
            . for mail
        - "PTR"
            . reverse of "A"
    - TTL (Time to live)
        . the length that a DNS record is cached on either the Resolving Server or the users own local PC is equal to the value of TTL in seconds
        . the lower the TTL, the faster changes to DNS records take to propagate throughout the internet

    - Exam tips:
        . ELBs do not have pre-defined IPv4 addressses; you resolve to them using DNS name
        . Alias vs CNAME
            - The ALIAS record maps a name to another name, but can coexist with other records on that name
            - The CNAME record maps a name to another name. It should only be used when there are no other records on that name.
            - prefer Alias in exam questions
