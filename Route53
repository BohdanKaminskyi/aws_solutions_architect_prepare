Route53
    - DNS Service
    - why named Route53 - DNS is on port 53
    - DNS is used to convert human-readable domain names into IP adresses
    - we created ipv6 because of running out of ipv4 adresses
    - top level domain - last word (.com, .edu)
    - top level domain names are controlled by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority in a root zone database
        (which is essentially a database of all available top level domains)
        . https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db - list of all top level domains
    - domain registrars
        . registrar is an authority that can assign domain names directly under one or more top-level domains
            - these domains are registered with InterNIC, a service of ICANN, which enforces uniqueness of domain
              names across the internet
            - each domain name becomes registered in a central database known as WhoIS database
    - each dns domain starts with SOA
        . SOA (Start Of Authority) Record
            - stores information about 
                . name of the server that supplied the data for the zone
                . administrator of the zone
                . current version of data file
                . default number of seconds for the TTL file on resource records
        . NS (Name Server) Record
            - used by top level domain servers to direct traffic to the Content DNS server which contains 
              the authoritative DNS records
    - Example: user types hellocloudguru.com
        1. browser goes to top level domain server (.com) and queries for authority record
        2. This gives you NS record
        3. Then you querying NS records
        4. This gives you SOA
        5. Here you get DNS records
     - Types of DNS records:
        - "A"
            . Address
            . Translates the name of the domain into IP Address
            . it's foundamental
        - "CNAME"
            . Can be used to resolve one domain name to another
            . example: you have m.site.com and you also want mobile.site.com to point to resovse to the same Address
        - "Alias"
            . used to map resources record sets in your hosted zone to Elastic Load Balancers, CloudFront distributions, or S3 buckets that are configured as websites
            . Alias records work like a CNAME record in that you can map one DNS name to another 'target' DNS name
        - "MX"
            . for mail
        - "PTR"
            . reverse of "A"
    - TTL (Time to live)
        . the length that a DNS record is cached on either the Resolving Server or the users own local PC is equal to the value of TTL in seconds
        . the lower the TTL, the faster changes to DNS records take to propagate throughout the internet

    - Exam tips:
        . ELBs do not have pre-defined IPv4 addressses; you resolve to them using DNS name
        . Alias vs CNAME
            - The ALIAS record maps a name to another name, but can coexist with other records on that name
            - The CNAME record maps a name to another name. It should only be used when there are no other records on that name.
            - prefer Alias in exam questions

In Route53 you specify ip-addresses of your EC2 instances


Routing policies:
    - Simple Routing
    - Weighted Routing
    - Latency-based Routing
    - Failover Routing
    - Geolocation Routing
    - Geoproximity Routing (Traffic Flow only)
    - Multivalue Answer Routing


Simple Routing
    - only record with multiple IP addresses
    - if you specify multiple values in a record, Route 53 returns all values to the user
      in a random order ( you don't know which EC2 instance will be used...)
    - after TTL, you probably will be on another EC2 instance


Weighted Routing Policy
    - allows you to split traffic based on different weights assigned
    - example: you can set 10% of your traffic to us-east-1 and 90% to go to eu-west-1
    - you can check 'Associate with Health Check'
        . you can set health checks on individual record sets
        . if a record set fails a health check it will be removed from Route53 until it passesthe health check
        . you can set SNS notifications to alert you if a health check is failed


Latency-Based Policy
    - allows you to route traffic based on the lowest network latency for your end user (ie which region will give them fastest response time)
    - to use Latency-Based Routing, you create a latency resource record set for the EC2 (or ELB) resource in each region 
      that hosts your website. When Route53 receives a query for your site, it selects the latency resource record set for the region
      that gives the user the lowest latency. Route53 responds with the value associated with the resource record set


Failover Policy
    - used when you want to create an active/passive set up. For example, you may want your primary site to be in EU-WEST-2
      and your secondary DR Site in AP-SOUTHEAST-2. Route53 will monitor the health of your primary site using a health check


Geolocation Policy
    - lets you choose where your traffic will be sent based on the geographic location of your users (ie the location from which 
       DNS queries originate). For example, you might want all queries from Europe to be routed to a fleet of EC2 instances that are specifically 
       configured for your European customers. These servers may have the local language of your European customers and all prices are displayed 
       in Euros


Geoproximity Policy (Traffic Flow Only)
    - lets Route53 route traffic to your resources based on the geographic location of your users and your resources
    - you can optionally choose to route more traffic or less to a given resource by specifying a value, known as bias.
       Bias expands or shrinks the size of the geographic region from which traffic is routed to a resource
    - to use geoproximity routing you must use Route53 traffic flow


Multivalue Answer Policy
    - allows you to configure Route53 to return multiple values, such as IP addresses for your web servers, in response to DNS queries.
       You can specify multiple values for almost any record, but Multivalue answer routing also lets you check the health of each resource,
       so Route53 returns only values for healthy resources
    - similar to Simple Routing however allows you to put health checks on each record set


Q: Which of the following Route 53 policies allow you to 
    a) route data to a second resource if the first is unhealthy, and 
    b) route data to resources that have better performance?
A: Failover Routing and Latency-based Routing

Q: Route53 is Amazon's DNS Service.
A: True

Q: Route53 is named so because ________.
A: DNS port is 53

Q: You have created a new subdomain for your popular website, 
    and you need this subdomain to point to an Elastic Load Balancer using Route53. Which DNS record set should you create?
A: CNAME

Q: True or False: There is a limit to the number of domain names that you can manage using Route 53.
A: True and False. With Route 53, there is a default limit of 50 domain names. However, this limit can be increased by contacting AWS support.

Q: You are hosting a website and would like visitors from United Kingdom to see a different site than those in Australia. 
    Which Routing Policy would help you to accomplish this?
A: Geolocation Routing

Q: Your company hosts 10 web servers all serving the same web content in AWS. 
    They want Route 53 to serve traffic to random web servers. 
    Which routing policy will meet this requirement, and provide the best resiliency?
A: Multivalue answer routing lets you configure Amazon Route 53 to return multiple values, such as IP addresses for your web servers, 
    in response to DNS queries. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records and gives different answers to different DNS resolvers.
    The choice of which to use is left to the requesting service effectively creating a form or randomisation.
