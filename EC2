EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
    - web service, that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud
    - reduces time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes
    - allows you to quickly scale capacity
    - pricing models:
        > On Demand
            . allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment
        > Reserved
            . capacity reservation, offers significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance
            . contract terms are 1 year/3 years
        > Spot
            . enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity
            . for cases when your applications have flexible start and end times
        > Dedicated Hosts
            . physical EC2 server dedicated for your use
            . can help reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses

EC2 Pricing models:
===
On Demand
    - for users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment
      or long-term commitment
    - applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
    - applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time

Reserved:
    - applications with steady state or predictable usage
    - applications that require reserved capacity
    - users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further
    types:
        > standart reserved instances
            - up to 75% off on demand instances
            - the more you pay up front and the longer the contract, the greater the discount
        > convertible reserved instances
            - offer up to 54% off on demand capability to change the attributes of the RI as long as the exchange
              results in the creation of Reserved Instances of equal or greater value
        > scheduled reserved instances
            - for specific time windows
    
Spot pricing
    - have flexible start and end time
    - for applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
    - for users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity
    - if spot instance is terminated by EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage

Dedicated hosts pricing:
    - for regulatory requirements / that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
    - for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
    - can be purchased On-Demand (hourly.)
    - can be purchased as a Reservation for up to 70% off the On-Demand price


EC2 lab
- Security group is basically a virtual firewall
- On EBS-backed instance, the default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted when the instance is terminated
- EBS root volumes on your default AMI's(Amazon Machine Images) cannot be encrypted,
  you can encrypt them with third-party tools (bit locker etc.)
  or this can be done when creating AMI's in AWS Console or using the API
Keypairs: 
    - public key -- can see anybody
    - private key -- in pair with public key give you access to open EC2 instance via SSH

SSH into instance:
    1. chmod 400 <your_key> # this gives you read-only access to key
    2. ssh ec2-user@54.147.64.7 -i <your_key>
    3. sudo su # to get superuser access # for rare cases...


Security Groups Basics
    - changes are applied immidiately
    - are stateful (if you add rule to inbound rule, it will also apply that for outbound)
    - there's no way to black-listing individual port/ip (use Network Access Control Lists instead)
    - all inbound traffic is blocked by default (you need to add rules for HTTP/RDS/etc.)
    - all outbound traffic is allowed
    - you can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group
    - by default, only 1 security group is attached to instance, but you can add other 'Actions'->Networking
    - you can specify allow rules, but not deny rules


EBS (Elastic Block Store)
    - provides persistent block storage volunes for EC2 instances
    - each EBS volume is automatically replicated within AZ 
    - comes in 5 flavours:
        . General Purpose (SSD)
            > balanced price and performance
            > named gp2
            > 1 GiB - 16 TiB
            > up to 16000 IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)
        . Provisioned IOPS (SSD)
            > highest performance SSD volume
            > designed for mission-critical applications
            > use-case: databases
            > named io1
            > 4 GiB - 16 TiB
            > up to 64000 IOPS
        . Throughput Optimized Hard Disk Drive
            > low cost hdd volume
            > for frequently-accessed, throughput-intensive workloads
            > for Big Data and Data Warehouses
            > named st1
            > 500 GiB - 16 TiB
            > 500 IOPS
        . Cold HDD
            > low cost hdd volume
            > for less frequently accessed workloads
            > for File Servers
            > named sc1
            > 500 GiB - 16 TiB
            > 250 IOPS
        . Magnetic (HDD)
            > previous gen HDD
            > workloads where data is infrequently accessed
            > named Standart
            > 1 GiB - 1 TiB
            > 40-200 IOPS


EBS Volumes & Snapshots
    - volume will be placed in same AZ as your instance
    - when you terminate an instance, root device volume is terminated, but other volumes persist
    - if you are changing not-root volume size, you'll need to repartition your OS in order to see a change
    - you do not need to change image 
    - Exam question: how to move instance/volume to another AZ: 
        1. create a snapshot 
        2. create image from snapshot (it will then be displayed in AMI section)
        3. then create instance from image, in 'Subnet' you can use subnet in another AZ
        # you can reassign Elastic IP address
    - you can also copy AMI and change 'Destination region' (to move across regions)
    - snapshots exist on S3
    - snapshots are point in time copies of Volumes
    - snapshots are incremental -- only the blocks that have changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3
    - to create a snapshot for an Amazon EBS volume that serves as a root device, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot
    - you can create AMI's from both Volumes and Snapshots


AMI Types (EBS vs Instance Store)
    AMI can be selected based on:
        - region
        - OS
        - Architecture (32-bit vs 64-bit)
        - Launch permissions
        - Storage for the Root device (Root device volume)
            . Instance Store (EPHEMERAL STORAGE)
                - cannot be stopped (if underlying host fails, you will loose your data)
                - can be rebooted without loosing data
            . EBS Backed Volumes
                - can be stopped. you will not loose data if the instance is stopped
                - can be rebooted without loosing data
    By default both ROOT volumes are deleted on instance termination. However with EBS volumes you can tell AWS
    to keep the root device volume


For EBS volumes: the root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Amazon EBS volume created from
Amazon EBS snapshot

For Instance Store volumes: the root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an instance store volume created 
from a template stored in Amazon S3


CloudWatch 101
    - monitoring service to monitor your AWS resources, as well as the applications that you run on AWS
    - basically monitors performance
    - can monitor:
        . Compute
            - EC2 instances
            - Autoscaling
            - Elastic Load Balancers
            - Route53 Health Checks
        . Storage & Content Delivery
            - EBS Volumes
            - Storage Gateways
            - CloudFront
        . Host Level metrics
            - CPU
            - Network
            - Disk
            - Status Check
    - CloudWatch with EC2 will monitor events every 5 minutes by default
    - you can have 1 minute intervals by turning on detailed monitoring
    - you can create CloudWatch alarms which trigger notifications
    - you need to 'Enable detailed CloudWatch monitoring'
    - you can create dashboards, alarms , events, logs

!Exam questions on CloudWatch vs CloudTrail

CloudTrail
    - increases visibility into your user and resource activity by recording AWS Management Console actions and API calls
    - you can identify which users and accounts called AWS, the source IP address from which the calls were made,
      and when the calls occured


AWS Command Line (CLI)
    - aws s3 mb s3://<name> # make bucket


IAM Roles
    - tap on instance 'Attach role' 
    - !!! do not store secret access key/keyID on EC2 instances
    - roles are universal
    - can be added to EC2 instance on runtime


Using Boot Strap scripts 
    - can automate EC2 deployments
    - when creating the instance 'Advanced details' you can for example:
        #!/bin/bash
        yum update -y
        yum install httpd -y
        service httpd start
        chkconfig httpd on
        cd /var/www/html
        echo "<html>//...dwadawfjawjw" > index.html
        aws s3 mb s3://somdwajdakldjsl
        aws s3 cp index.html s3://somdwajdakldjsl
    
        // this will create a website after instance is up and running


EC2 instance Metadata/UserData
    - curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
    - curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/ # boot strap script you passed


EFS (Elastic File System)
    - file storage service for EC2 instances
    - allows you to create and configure file systems
    - with EFS, storage capacity is elastic
    - two EC2 instances cannot share EBS volume, but can EFS volume
    - add: yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
    - uses NFSv4
    - you only pay for storage you use
    - can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections
    - data is stored across multiple AZ's within a region
    - Read after write consistency


EC2 Placement Groups
    - 3 types
        . Clustered Placement Group
            - grouping of instances within a single AZ
            - recommended for applications that need low network latency, high network throughput
            - only certain types of instances can be launched in to a Clustered Placement Group
        . Spread Placement Group
            - each instance is placed on distinct underlying hardware
            - recommended for apps that have a small number of critical instances that should be kept 
              separate from each other
            - think of it like 'individual instances'
        . Partitioned Placement Group
            - EC2 divides each group into logical segments called partitions
            - EC2 ensures that each partition within a placement group has it's own set of racks
            - each rack has it's own network and power source
            - no two partitions within a placement group share the same racks, allowing you to isolate
              the impact of hardware failure within you application
            - think of it like 'multiple instances'
            - for use with multiple EC2 instances HDFS, HBase, and Cassandra clusters


Q&A

Q: When creating a new security group, all inbound traffic is allowed by default.
A: False (For an 'new' security group nothing is allowed in by default. )

Q: Can a placement group be deployed across multiple Availability Zones?
A: No (Spread or Partition placement groups)

Q: To help you manage your Amazon EC2 instances, you can assign your own metadata in the form of ____
A: Tags (https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/aws-tagging-strategies/)

Q: In order to enable encryption at rest using EC2 and Elastic Block Store, you must ________
A: Configure encryption when creating the EBS volume (Using AWS managed keys to provide EBS encryption at rest is a relatively painless and reliable way to protect assets and demonstrate
    your professionalism in any commercial situation.)

Q: Can I move a reserved instance from one region to another?
A: No (Depending on you type of RL you can You can modify the; AZ, scope, network platform, or instance size (within the same instance type). 
   But not Region. In some circumstances you can sell RIs, but only if you have a US bank account.)

Q: You need to know both the private IP address and public IP address of your EC2 instance. You should ________.
A: Retrieve the instance Metadata from http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

Q: Amazon's EBS volumes are ________.
A: Block based storage (EBS, EFS, and FSx are all storage services base on Block storage)

Q: If an Amazon EBS volume is an additional partition (not the root volume), can I detach it without stopping the instance?
A: Yes, although it may take some time.

Q: You can add multiple volumes to an EC2 instance and then create your own RAID 5/RAID 10/RAID 0 configurations using those volumes.
A: True

Q: Individual instances are provisioned ________.
A: Availability Zones

Q: Placement Groups can be created across 2 or more Availability Zones.
A: True

Q: Is it possible to perform actions on an existing Amazon EBS Snapshot?
A: Yes, through AWS APIs, CLI, and AWS Console

Q: You have developed a new web application in the US-West-2 Region that requires six Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances to be running at all times.
   US-West-2 comprises three Availability Zones (us-west-2a, us-west-2b, and us-west-2c). 
   You need 100 percent fault tolerance: should any single Availability Zone in us-west-2 become unavailable, the application must continue to run. 
   How would you make sure 6 servers are ALWAYS available? NOTE: each answer has 2 possible deployment configurations. 
   Select the answer that gives TWO satisfactory solutions to this scenario.
A: Solution 1: us-west-2a with six EC2 instances, us-west-2b with six EC2 instances, and us-west-2c with no EC2 instances. 
   Solution 2: us-west-2a with three EC2 instances, us-west-2b with three EC2 instances, and us-west-2c with three EC2 instances.

Q: The use of a cluster placement group is ideal _______
A: Your fleet of EC2 instances requires high network throughput and low latency within a single availability zone.

Q: EBS Snapshots are backed up to S3 in what manner?
A: Incrementally

Q: Can I delete a snapshot of an EBS Volume that is used as the root device of a registered AMI?
A: No

Q: Which AWS CLI command should I use to create a snapshot of an EBS volume?
A: aws ec2 create-snapshot

Q: I can change the permissions to a role, even if that role is already assigned to an existing EC2 instance, and these changes will take effect immediately.
A: True

Q: To retrieve instance metadata or user data you will need to use the following IP Address:
A: http://169.254.169.254

Q: Will an Amazon EBS root volume persist independently from the life of the terminated EC2 instance to which it was previously attached? 
   In other words, if I terminated an EC2 instance, would that EBS root volume persist?
A: You can control whether an EBS root volume is deleted when its associated instance is terminated. 
   The default delete-on-termination behaviour depends on whether the volume is a root volume, or an additional volume. 
   By default, the DeleteOnTermination attribute for root volumes is set to 'true.' 
   However, this attribute may be changed at launch by using either the AWS Console or the command line. 
   For an instance that is already running, the DeleteOnTermination attribute must be changed using the CLI.

Q: I can use the AWS Console to add a role to an EC2 instance after that instance has been created and powered-up.
A: True

Q: Can you attach an EBS volume to more than one EC2 instance at the same time?
A: No
