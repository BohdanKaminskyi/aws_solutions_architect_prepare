EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
    - web service, that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud
    - reduces time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes
    - allows you to quickly scale capacity
    - pricing models:
        > On Demand
            . allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment
        > Reserved
            . capacity reservation, offers significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance
            . contract terms are 1 year/3 years
        > Spot
            . enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity
            . for cases when your applications have flexible start and end times
        > Dedicated Hosts
            . physical EC2 server dedicated for your use
            . can help reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses

EC2 Pricing models:
===
On Demand
    - for users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment
      or long-term commitment
    - applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
    - applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time

Reserved:
    - applications with steady state or predictable usage
    - applications that require reserved capacity
    - users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further
    types:
        > standart reserved instances
            - up to 75% off on demand instances
            - the more you pay up front and the longer the contract, the greater the discount
        > convertible reserved instances
            - offer up to 54% off on demand capability to change the attributes of the RI as long as the exchange
              results in the creation of Reserved Instances of equal or greater value
        > scheduled reserved instances
            - for specific time windows
    
Spot pricing
    - have flexible start and end time
    - for applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
    - for users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity
    - if spot instance is terminated by EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage

Dedicated hosts pricing:
    - for regulatory requirements / that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
    - for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
    - can be purchased On-Demand (hourly.)
    - can be purchased as a Reservation for up to 70% off the On-Demand price


EC2 lab
- Security group is basically a virtual firewall
- On EBS-backed instance, the default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted when the instance is terminated
- EBS root volumes on your default AMI's cannot be encrypted, you can encrypt them with third-party tools (bit locker etc.)
  or this can be done when creating AMI's in AWS Console or using the API
Keypairs: 
    - public key -- can see anybody
    - private key -- in pair with public key give you access to open EC2 instance via SSH

SSH into instance:
    1. chmod 400 <your_key> # this gives you read-only access to key
    2. ssh ec2-user@54.147.64.7 -i <your_key>
    3. sudo su # to get superuser access # for rare cases...


Security Groups Basics
- changes are applied immidiately
- are stateful (if you add rule to inbound rule, it will also apply that for outbound)
- there's no way to black-listing individual port/ip (use Network Access Control Lists instead)
- all inbound traffic is blocked by default (you need to add rules for HTTP/RDS/etc.)
- all outbound traffic is allowed
- you can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group
- by default, only 1 security group is attached to instance, but you can add other 'Actions'->Networking
- you can specify allow rules, but not deny rules
