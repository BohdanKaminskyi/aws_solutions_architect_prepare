EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
    - web service, that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud
    - reduces time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes
    - allows you to quickly scale capacity
    - pricing models:
        > On Demand
            . allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment
        > Reserved
            . capacity reservation, offers significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance
            . contract terms are 1 year/3 years
        > Spot
            . enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity
            . for cases when your applications have flexible start and end times
        > Dedicated Hosts
            . physical EC2 server dedicated for your use
            . can help reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses

EC2 Pricing models:
===
On Demand
    - for users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment
      or long-term commitment
    - applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
    - applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time

Reserved:
    - applications with steady state or predictable usage
    - applications that require reserved capacity
    - users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further
    types:
        > standart reserved instances
            - up to 75% off on demand instances
            - the more you pay up front and the longer the contract, the greater the discount
        > convertible reserved instances
            - offer up to 54% off on demand capability to change the attributes of the RI as long as the exchange
              results in the creation of Reserved Instances of equal or greater value
        > scheduled reserved instances
            - for specific time windows
    
Spot pricing
    - have flexible start and end time
    - for applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
    - for users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity

Dedicated hosts pricing:
    - for regulatory requirements / that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
    - for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
    - can be purchased On-Demand (hourly.)
    - can be purchased as a Reservation for up to 70% off the On-Demand price
