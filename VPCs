VPCs 101
    - VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) 
    - think of it as Virtual Data Centre in the Cloud
    - let's you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS where you can launch resources
       in the virtual network you define
    - you have ocmplete control over your virtual environment including selection of IP ranges,
       creation of subnets and configuration of route tables and network gateways


VPC structure:
    - on the outside of VPC we have 2 gateways - Internet Gateway and Virtual Private Gateway
    - both of these connections go to a router
    - router then directs traffic to Route tables
    - then Route tables will direct traffic through Network ACLs (that's first line of defence), like firewall or security groups
    - Network ACLs are stateless (when Security Groups are statefull):
        . allow/deny rules can be added
        . you can block specific IP adresses
    - then we move to Security Groups which are statefull (futher line of defence)
    - and here we have 2 different subnets:
        . PUBLIC SN 
            - internet traffic is accessible for any EC2 instances here
        . PRIVATE SN
            - EC2 instance cannot connect to the internet on it's own
            - you can still connect to that EC2 instance, but that's only possible if you first ssh into instance 
               in public subnet, and from it ssh into private one
            - there are 3 ranges of IPs reserved for private subnets:
                . 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)
                . 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)
                . 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)
